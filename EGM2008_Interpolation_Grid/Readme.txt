Software and Grids for WGS 84 Geoid Undulation Computation by Interpolation 


Interpolation Program for 2.5 x 2.5 Minute Geoid Grid (interp_2p5min.f - 28 KB) - Use this FORTRAN program to interpolate geoid undulations from the 2.5 x 2.5-Minute Geoid Undulation Grid file, for any WGS 84 latitude/longitude coordinate pair listed in a coordinate input file (such as INPUT.DAT). When applied to the 2.5 x 2.5-Minute Geoid Undulation Grid file, this interp_2p5min.f program will generate geoid undulation values that match the corresponding values generated by harmonic synthesis (hsynth_WGS84.f or hsynth_WGS84.exe above) to within 1 cm. The interp_2p5min.f program requires that the 2.5 x 2.5-Minute Geoid Undulation Grid file and the INPUT.DAT are located in the same directory as interp_2p5min.f. 


2.5 x 2.5-Minute Interpolation Executable for Windows XP (interp_2p5min.exe - 434 KB) - Windows executable version of the Interpolation Program for 2.5 x 2.5 Minute Geoid Grid. Use as described above. To be used with the SMALL ENDIAN Geoid Undulation Grid below. 


2.5 x 2.5-Minute Geoid Undulation Grid in WGS 84 - SMALL ENDIAN (Und_min2.5x2.5_egm2008_isw=82_WGS84_TideFree_SE.gz - 135 MB) - 2.5 x 2.5-minute global grid of pre-computed geoid undulations. This file has a SMALL ENDIAN internal binary representation. 


2.5 x 2.5-Minute Geoid Undulation Grid in WGS 84 - BIG ENDIAN (Und_min2.5x2.5_egm2008_isw=82_WGS84_TideFree.gz - 135 MB) - 2.5 x 2.5-minute global grid of pre-computed geoid undulations. This file has a BIG ENDIAN internal binary representation. 


INPUT.DAT (4 KB) - sample input file of WGS 84 latitude/longitude coordinate pairs for testing the Interpolation Program for 2.5 x 2.5-Minute Geoid Grid. 


OUTPUT.DAT (4 KB)- sample output file of geoid undulation values, generated by reading INPUT.DAT into the Interpolation Program for 2.5 x 2.5-Minute Geoid Grid above (for test verification).
