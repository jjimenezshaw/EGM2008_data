# EGM2008 data

The page https://earth-info.nga.mil/ is many times down, or the links are not working.

I was lucky in November 2023 and was able to download two zip files `EGM2008_Interpolation_Grid.zip` and `EGM2008_Spherical_Harmonics.zip`. You can see here the unziped folders in this repo. (GitHub does not allow me to upload files larger than 100 MB)

[README_WGS84_2.pdf](README_WGS84_2.pdf) is the documentation repeated in both zips.

The grid at 1' resolution is available at: https://grid-partner-share.s3.amazonaws.com/egm2008/Und_min1x1_egm2008_isw%3D82_WGS84_TideFree.gz
